# spls -- obsolete 

Julia Package for Sparse PLS regression. Package will be archived. 

Please have a look at [RitSpls.jl](https://github.com/LucaIns/RitSpls.jl), a much more comprehensive package that includes 
- sparse PLS with option to use SNIPLS or Sparse Helland ``Shelland" algorithms
- sparse PLS influence function and asymptotic variance
- Robustness inducing transformations: generalized spatial sign and wrapping trabsformtion
- cross-validation utilities.
